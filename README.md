# contact_manager
A simple web-app written in PHP that allows users to view contact content from a database, edit that content, and upload new contacts on demand.

## Step 1

Clone this repository to a suitable directory.

## Step 2

Point a MAMP server to the cloned directory as the 'home' folder.

## Step 3

Create a new database called "p2" in phpMyAdmin.

## Step 4

Import the .sql file into phpMyAdmin. This will set up the table and provide a few sample values.

## Step 5

Visit index.php. Everything should be up and running.

### Notes

If you would like to test out the image upload feature, please use a sample image from the "uploads" folder, or get a ".jpg" file that is 640x480.
